This is a desktop application written when I attended the Wayne Technical and Career Center during high school. At WTCC the out-of-school suspension services are hosted for the county surrounding WTCC. This application was responsible for maintaining communication between home schools and the suspension center by sending attendance reports, sending and receiving school work, accounting, and lunch orders for the cafeteria.
